# Course description

**Part A:** *Parallel programming with MPI and running on Google Cloud Platform virtual cluster*

**Part B:** *Fundamentals on concurrency and parallel systems*  

The growing demand for more computing power is hard to fulfill. Modern computer architectures permit even more significant problems in various applications by adopting many computing systems, from personal multicore processors to high-performance systems or even co-processors such as GPU. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to parallel computing and concurrency, discussing the model of parallel algorithms and practical issues, such as designing and implementing distributed-memory programs by adopting the MPI standard. Moreover, the course will investigate cloud computing architectures as high-performance computing platforms. In particular, the Google Cloud Platform provider will be described, which will be exploited to create and manage clusters of machines for executing parallel programs written in C using OpenMPI.
