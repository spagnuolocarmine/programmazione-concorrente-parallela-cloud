# ðŸ“¢ Course Research Forum

## Welcome to our Course Research Forum for the PCPC course!

In this engaging event, students are divided into groups and have the opportunity to present research articles on a specific topic related to parallel computing, distributed computing, or cloud computing. Each group carefully selects and analyzes a relevant article, leading to in-depth and stimulating discussions. The Research Forum provides a dynamic space to explore the latest scientific discoveries and promote knowledge sharing among participants and is a required task to access the oral examination.
